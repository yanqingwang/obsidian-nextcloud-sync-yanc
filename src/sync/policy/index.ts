// as text — without touching the network, the disk, or engine state. They lived as private methods
// only because that is where they were written; nothing about them needs an engine instance.
//
// Exported as plain functions rather than a class. A class here would imply there is something to
// construct and inject, and there is not: every input arrives as an argument. That is deliberate, and
// it is what makes these directly testable — several of them previously had no test that named them,
// because reaching them meant standing up a SyncEngine first.
//
// Where a predicate used to read an ambient value (`Date.now()`, `this.opts.settings`, the state DB),
// that value is now a parameter. The caller resolves it. This is the whole reason the safety-window
// logic below can be exercised at its boundaries at all.

 * not indirection for its own sake: the original read them only after the signature and size/mtime
 * checks had passed, and this predicate runs once per file on the fast path. Taking plain numbers
